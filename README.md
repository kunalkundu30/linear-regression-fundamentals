# linear-regression-fundamentals

The notebook 'linear regression.ipynb' visualizes key assumptions of linear regrssion.

Assumptions for equalisation of MSE minimisation to MLE maximisation:

1. Linearity
    There is linear relationship between features and target.
2. Normality
    The errors are normally distributed with mean 0.
3. Homoscedasticity
    The standard deviation of errors is same for error distribution for all samples.
4. Independence of samples and errors
    The samples and errors are drawn independent to each other.

Assumption for robustness:
1. Multi-collinearity
    The features are not correlated with each other.
